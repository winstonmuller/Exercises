Exercises
=========

A solution full of short programming exercises, mainly for myself. Some may be incomplete, some may not be very good at all.  Like a scratchpad, that I want to keep. Every so often I find myself thinking about some "throwaway" code I wrote a few weeks ago, and wondering what would happen if I optimized it in a particular way or solved it using a library function I didn't previously know about etc. That is what this repo is for.
